## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Canvas (#ebeadf) as the base background for most page sections, ensuring a warm and inviting feel.
- Apply Ink (#000000) for all primary text, borders, and iconography to maintain high contrast and legibility.
- Round corners with a 12px radius for all general cards and containers, and 999px for pill-shaped buttons and tags.
- Elevate critical information or calls to action by placing them on Tangerine (#f04923) backgrounds.
- Utilize Supreme LL TT for all typographic elements, leveraging its specific letter-spacing of -0.0500em for a refined appearance.
- Break up content with sections using Sandstone (#d5cec0) to create subtle, visual segmentation without harsh divisions.
- Maintain an element gap of 12px for consistent spacing between interactive elements and content blocks.

### Don't
- Avoid using harsh white backgrounds unless for specific component surfaces, to preserve the warm aesthetic.
- Do not use multiple accent colors; Tangerine (#f04923) should be the singular vibrant accent.
- Do not vary border radii outside of 12px for cards and 999px for buttons, to maintain shape consistency.
- Avoid generic system fonts; always prioritize Supreme LL TT for brand consistency.
- Do not over-emphasize elements with heavy shadows or gradients; the design relies on color and spacing for hierarchy.
- Do not use Tangerine (#f04923) for text or small icons unless against a very light background, due to insufficient contrast against other brand colors.
- Avoid excessive padding or small element gaps, as the system favors comfortable density with an element gap of 12px and card padding of 24px.

## Imagery
The site heavily features product photography, presented as hero assets against vibrant backgrounds or styled within realistic kitchen environments. Products are typically shown cleanly, often against white or neutral backdrops in a studio setting, or as central objects in lifestyle vignettes. Illustrations are minimal, predominantly used for branding or small decorative accents. Icons are monochromatic, using clean outlines. Imagery serves to showcase product functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## Layout
The page structure utilizes a contained layout with a comfortable density. Hero sections are dynamic, often featuring full-bleed vibrant backgrounds with product-focused imagery and overlaid text. Content sections follow a patterned rhythm, alternating between full-width immersive scenes (like the kitchen environment) and structured grid layouts for product display. A consistent vertical spacing strategy is employed using a base unit of 4px. Navigation is handled by a sticky top bar with minimal links. Product grids are typically 4-column, displaying items with associated pricing and 'Bestseller' tags.
