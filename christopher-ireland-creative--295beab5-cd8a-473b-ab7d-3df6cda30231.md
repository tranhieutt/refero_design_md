This design evokes the timeless elegance of classic publishing, presenting photography and direction with a quiet authority. The aesthetic is built on a high-contrast pairing of deep charcoal text against an almost-white background, creating a sense of clarity and focus. The interplay between the bold, serif display typography and the clean, sans-serif body text provides a distinct visual hierarchy, while minimal use of decorative elements contributes to its refined, uncluttered feel. Expansive spacing acts as a canvas, allowing content to breathe and command attention without distraction, much like a curated art gallery.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Canvas Parchment (#f2f1ec) as the primary background color for all page sections to maintain a clean, expansive base.
- Employ Playfair Display at 94px for critical, impactful headlines to leverage its editorial aesthetic and high visual presence.
- Pair Playfair Display for display elements with Rubik (16px, weight 400) for all body text, ensuring a clear typographic distinction and readability.
- Maintain generous vertical spacing between content blocks, with a default section gap of 48px to create an airy, curated feel.
- Keep borders and interactive underlines in Charcoal Ink (#000000) to ensure high contrast and visual consistency.

### Don't
- Avoid applying strong background colors or gradients to content cards; keep them transparent with 'Canvas Parchment' as the implied background.
- Do not introduce additional font families or weights beyond Rubik 400 and Playfair Display 400; the system relies on this limited palette.
- Refrain from using prominent box-shadows or elevation. The design achieves depth through typography and spacing.
- Do not round corners on any elements; the system explicitly adheres to 0px border-radius for a crisp, precise geometry.
- Avoid diluting the neutral color palette with vivid accent colors; the brand emphasizes subtlety through tone and texture.

## Imagery
The visual language focuses on high-quality, atmospheric photography used as hero content. Images are typically contained, not full-bleed, and serve as a focal point demonstrating the individual's artistic output. There's no specific masking or corner treatment; images are rectangular and integrated cleanly into the spacious layout. The lighting and composition within the images suggest a naturalistic, intimate, and often subtly dramatic approach without overt staging. They function as both decorative atmosphere and direct demonstration of professional work.

## Layout
The site employs a primarily centered, max-width layout, though 'pageMaxWidth' is not strictly defined, suggesting an adaptive but contained approach rather than full-bleed. The hero section features a prominent, centered headline with a sub-line, immediately establishing a personal brand. Content below this is divided by subtle horizontal rules. Sections typically feature generous vertical spacing (48px). The main content area uses a split-screen approach on the main hero, with large display typography on one side and a key photograph on the other. Navigation and secondary information are integrated into the header and within content blocks, using a minimalist approach with simple text links.
