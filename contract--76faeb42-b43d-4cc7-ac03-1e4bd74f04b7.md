> Architectural Blueprint on Marble: Precise lines and forms over a neutral, expansive canvas.

The Contract design system by MDF Italia embodies a refined, architectural blueprint aesthetic: a stark monochromatic palette emphasizes structure and form. Typography is the primary visual communicator, utilizing a wide range of weights to establish hierarchy rather than color. Surfaces are clean and unadorned, promoting a focus on product photography and minimal, precise UI elements. The overall impression is one of understated luxury and functional clarity, where space and proportion play a crucial role.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas White | `#ffffff` | `--color-canvas-white` | Page backgrounds, elevated card surfaces, clean backdrop for product visuals |
| Ink Black | `#000000` | `--color-ink-black` | Primary text, headings, strong outlines, section backgrounds for contrast. Creates a bold, definitive visual anchor |
| Ash Gray | `#e5e7eb` | `--color-ash-gray` | Soft icon strokes, subtle dividers, and low-emphasis decorative details. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Slate Text | `#6b7280` | `--color-slate-text` | Muted secondary text, placeholder text in input fields, less prominent UI elements |
| Medium Gray | `#b3b3b3` | `--color-medium-gray` | Tertiary text, subtle descriptions, copyright information. Used for low-priority textual content |
| Light Gray | `#bbbbbb` | `--color-light-gray` | Very subtle descriptive text, fine print, or as a background accent to text for very low hierarchy |
| Azure Accent | `#2563eb` | `--color-azure-accent` | Violet text accent for links, tags, and emphasized short phrases. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |

## Components

### Primary Ghost Button
**Role:** Interactive control for primary actions, presenting as an outlined element to maintain a light visual footprint.
Background: transparent (rgba(0,0,0,0)), Text: Ink Black (#000000), Border: 1px solid Ash Gray (#e5e7eb) on top, Padding: 18px top/bottom, 48px left/right. Radius: 0px.

### Text Link Button
**Role:** Minimal interactive control for navigation or secondary actions, appearing as plain text.
Background: transparent (rgba(0,0,0,0)), Text: Ink Black (#000000), No explicit border. Padding: 0px.

### Text Input Field
**Role:** User input area for forms.
Background: transparent (rgba(0,0,0,0)), Text: Ink Black (#000000), Border: 1px solid Slate Text (#6b7280). Padding: 8px top/bottom, 12px left/right. Radius: 0px. Placeholder text is Slate Text (#6b7280).

### Office Product Card
**Role:** Display individual product categories or offerings.
Background for product card: Canvas White (#ffffff). No visible border radius, hard edges. Features strong black text for titles, with smaller slate or gray text for descriptions. Visual elements are contained within the card's bounds without overlap.

### Key Value Circle
**Role:** Highlights key features or services within a section.
Comprises a white circular outline over a Canvas White (#ffffff) background. Text is Ink Black (#000000), typically centered in the circle. The graphic is a white circle, the structure is created by the black text and the negative space. The radius of the circle is undefined in the tokens but visually large and soft-edged.

### Download Catalog Link
**Role:** Direct call to action for downloading detailed information.
Text: Ink Black (#000000), typically accompanied by an icon or visual cue. No explicit background or padding, presented as a standard link. Underlined on hover.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize Ink Black (#000000) for all primary text and headings.
- Use Canvas White (#ffffff) for all main section backgrounds and card surfaces.
- Apply Plain typeface with specific letter-spacing values as defined in Typography for all text elements to maintain precise optical rhythm.
- Utilize Ash Gray (#e5e7eb) for subtle borders and dividers between content blocks and interactive elements.
- Maintain a compact density with an 8px element gap and 12px internal padding for cards.
- Form inputs should feature a 1px solid Slate Text (#6b7280) border with a 0px radius, aligning with the clean, unornamented aesthetic.
- Only use Azure Accent (#2563eb) for specific interactive feedback such as focus states or informational messages, never as a primary brand color.

### Don't
- Avoid using saturated background colors; all primary backgrounds should adhere to Canvas White (#ffffff) or Ink Black (#000000).
- Do not introduce decorative shadows or heavy gradients; the system relies on flat surfaces and high contrast.
- Refrain from using varied border radii across components; stick to 0px for most elements and 2px only for inputs.
- Do not deviate from the specified letter-spacing for 'Plain' font; optical precision is critical for this brandâs typographic identity.
- Do not use color to create hierarchy in text; rely on font weight and size variations within the `Plain` typeface.
- Avoid large, impactful graphics unless they are product photography; maintain a text-dominant, information-focused layout.
- Do not add unnecessary padding or margin; adhere to the defined spacing tokens for a consistently compact arrangement.

## Imagery
Imagery primarily consists of high-quality product photography and architectural renders. These visuals are typically contained within their sections, often shown as part of a larger composition or in a grid, with clean edges. Product shots are often full-frame or tightly cropped, emphasizing the material and form of the furniture. There are minimal decorative illustrations or abstract graphics. Icons are monochrome, typically filled where present, and serve a functional purpose.

## Layout
The page primarily uses a full-bleed layout for sections, with strong visual separation often created by alternating Ink Black (#000000) and Canvas White (#ffffff) backgrounds. Content within these sections is typically contained within a maximum width (not explicitly defined, but visually present). The hero section features a large, striking image or video. Content is often arranged in simple two-column text-left/image-right patterns or centered stacking for emphasis. Card grids are used for feature presentation or product categories. Navigation is a minimalist top bar, with elements appearing lightweight and subservient to the main content.

## Agent Prompt Guide

Quick Color Reference:
text: #000000
background: #ffffff
border: #e5e7eb
accent: #2563eb
primary action: no distinct CTA color

Example Component Prompts:
No distinct primary action color was observed; use the extracted neutral button treatments instead of inventing a filled CTA color.
2. Create a heading section: background Canvas White (#ffffff). Headline 'Contract, according to mdf italia' at 100px Plain weight 300, Ink Black (#000000), letter-spacing -0.0500em. Subtext 'Pioneers in a new way of conceiving space...' at 18px Plain weight 400, Ink Black (#000000), letter-spacing -0.0020em.
3. Create an Input Field: background rgba(0,0,0,0), text Ink Black (#000000), 1px solid Slate Text (#6b7280) border, 8px vertical padding, 12px horizontal padding, 2px radius. Placeholder text Slate Text (#6b7280).
4. Create a 'Key values' section: background Canvas White (#ffffff). Heading 'Key values' at 50px Plain weight 600, Ink Black (#000000). Below the heading, create a three-column grid of 'Key Value Circle' components each with Ink Black (#000000) text (e.g., 'Bespoke products').
