Cosmos Network embodies a 'sophisticated darkness' aesthetic, utilizing a deep black canvas with stark white typography and subtle, near-gray surface treatments for content segmentation. The visual system projects authority and precision through a constrained color palette and compact, feature-rich typography. This creates a high-contrast, information-dense environment where text and data take precedence, punctuated by minimal UI elements that maintain a serious, technology-forward presence. Interactive elements are sparse, emphasizing clarity over visual flair.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Midnight Abyss | `#000000` | `--color-midnight-abyss` | Page backgrounds, significant surface areas like navigation. Serves as the primary dark foundation |
| Ghost White | `#ffffff` | `--color-ghost-white` | Neutral form states, badge text, and quiet UI feedback where color should stay understated. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Iron Slate | `#333333` | `--color-iron-slate` | Subtle borders and dividers, background for select text fields |
| Faded Steel | `#807f7f` | `--color-faded-steel` | Muted secondary text, placeholder text, and decorative borders. Adds visual depth without distracting from primary content |
| Card Dark | `#1e1f20` | `--color-card-dark` | Background for secondary content cards, slightly lighter than the page background to denote a surface level |
| Frost | `#f1f4f4` | `--color-frost` | Subtle background for specific sections or elements, offering a brief respite from the dominant dark mode |
| Interface Green | `#22e2a8` | `--color-interface-green` | Green wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |

## Components

### Navigation Link
**Role:** Primary navigation item
Ghost White text on Midnight Abyss background, no padding, no explicit border radius, effectively 0px. Text color #ffffff. Interactive elements in navigation use the accent green for status indicators or subtle background highlights.

### Ghost Button
**Role:** Secondary action or link
Transparent background, Ghost White text (#ffffff), and a sharp, 0px border radius. This minimizes visual weight, maintaining a clean, text-driven interface.

### Feature Card (Dark)
**Role:** Container for secondary content like customer showcases.
Background is Card Dark (#1e1f20), with a 20px border radius and 20px padding on all sides. No box shadow, relying on subtle background difference for visual separation.

### Header Card (Dark, Large)
**Role:** Prominent content container for key sections.
Background is Card Dark (#1e1f20), with a distinctive 32px border radius. Generous internal padding of 88px top/bottom and 153.6px left/right for ample content breathing room.

### Default Input Field
**Role:** Standard input for user data.
Transparent background, Ghost White text (#ffffff), and a 0px border radius. The default state is a ghost text input without visible borders, integrating seamlessly with the dark background.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize Midnight Abyss (#000000) for all significant background areas to maintain the system's dark theme.
- Use Ghost White (#ffffff) for all primary text and critical UI elements to ensure high contrast and readability.
- Apply the `The Future` typeface with its specific font feature settings ('ss02', 'ss09') for all text elements to preserve brand identity.
- Segment content using subtle shifts in background color like Card Dark (#1e1f20) for cards, rather than relying on shadows or heavy borders.
- Maintain sharp edges for primary interactive elements, using a 0px border radius for ghost buttons and navigation links.
- Use Interface Green (#22e2a8) sparingly, only for small interactive indicators, active states, or subtle accent details.
- Apply a 20px border radius consistently to feature cards to soften their appearance while maintaining structural clarity.

### Don't
- Avoid using saturated background colors or multiple vivid accents; the system prioritizes a monochrome, high-contrast palette.
- Do not introduce drop shadows for elevation; rely on background color changes for surface differentiation.
- Do not use generic system fonts; `The Future` with its specific settings is critical for typographic identity.
- Avoid overly complex layouts or decorative gradients; emphasize clean, structured content presentation.
- Do not use heavily padded or filled buttons as primary calls to action; prefer ghost or text-based interactions.
- Do not use large, rounded corners on primary interactive elements; keep them sharp with 0px radius.
- Avoid mixing light and dark themes unless explicitly for a specific component variation.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Base Canvas | `#000000` | Primary page background for all sections. |
| 1 | Content Card | `#1e1f20` | Background for feature cards and secondary content blocks, slightly elevated from the base canvas. |

## Imagery
The visual language for imagery is primarily functional and understated. Product-focused graphics, often represented as abstract, glowing spherical elements or simplified interface diagrams, convey complex technology concepts rather than aspirational lifestyle photography. These are typically contained within sections, not full-bleed, and utilize the system's core dark and accent colors. Icons are minimalist, outlined rather than filled, with a light stroke weight, primarily in Ghost White or subtle gray tones, and occasionally accented with Interface Green. Overall density is moderate, with imagery serving explanatory or illustrative roles complementing dense blocks of text.

## Layout
The page maintains a max-width contained layout rather than full-bleed, with primary content centered. The hero section is a full-width dark background with a large, centered headline and a supporting text block, accompanied by an abstract, data-visualization graphic. Section rhythm is primarily consistent vertical spacing on a continuous dark background, with content blocks appearing as distinct cards or text-heavy paragraphs. Content arrangement often features a single column of text or a split layout with text on the left and imagery/cards on the right, or a grid of 3-4 feature cards. There is a prominent sticky top navigation with subtle links.
