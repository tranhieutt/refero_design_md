Counterprint's visual system evokes a precise, almost utilitarian aesthetic, reminiscent of classic design publishing. The core palette is primarily achromatic, relying on sharp black text against stark white surfaces and soft gray borders. Typography is confident and compact, favoring a system sans-serif for most content, with a custom geometric sans-serif for specific branding. Components are lightweight, emphasizing function over embellishment, with generous use of infinite border-radius for buttons and subtle rounded corners for input fields, providing a touch of approachability within the otherwise rigorous structure.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas White | `#ffffff` | `--color-canvas-white` | Page backgrounds, hero sections, and primary surface fills. Provides a clean, bright foundation |
| Text Black | `#1c1c1c` | `--color-text-black` | Primary text color for headings, body copy, links, and icons. Establishes strong contrast against light surfaces |
| Border Gray | `#e5e7eb` | `--color-border-gray` | Subtle borders for separating elements, list dividers, and outlined buttons. Defines structure without adding visual weight |

## Tokens - Typography

- **Weights:** 400, 700
- **Sizes:** 15px, 20px
- **Line height:** 1.00
- **Letter spacing:** -0.025em
- **Role:** Dominant typeface for all interface elements, body text, links, and buttons. Its compact tracking and neutral character contribute to the system's precise, information-dense feel.

### GTStandard-M - Used for specific branding elements and potentially some content accents, providing a distinct, non-system font texture. - `--font-gtstandard-m`
- **Substitute:** sans-serif
- **Weights:** 400
- **Sizes:** 15px
- **Line height:** 1.50
- **Letter spacing:** normal

## Tokens - Spacing & Shapes

- **Section gap:** 28px
- **Card padding:** 8px
- **Element gap:** 8px

### Border Radius

| Element | Value |
|---|---|
| inputs | 15px |
| others | 9999px |
| buttons | 9999px |

## Components

### Primary Ghost Button
**Role:** Interactive element
Ghost button with Text Black text on Canvas White background, outlined by Border Gray. Features a 9999px border-radius for a soft, pill-like appearance. Padding is 3.75px vertical and 7.5px horizontal. Uses Helvetica 15px, weight 400.

### Text Link Button
**Role:** Interactive element
Minimalist button appearing as plain text in Text Black, on a transparent background. No explicit padding or border-radius, aligning with content flow. Used for secondary actions or navigation items. Uses Helvetica 15px.

### Search Input Field
**Role:** Data entry
Transparent background input with Text Black text and a Text Black border. Features a 15px border-radius for a softly rounded aesthetic. Padding is 3.75px vertical and 7.5px horizontal. Uses Helvetica 15px.

### Product Grid Item
**Role:** Display component for products
Displays product images, names, and prices. The items are tightly packed with 8px horizontal and 19px vertical spacing between elements. Text is Text Black on a Canvas White background.

### Nav Menu Item
**Role:** Navigation link
Navigation links use Text Black on transparent backgrounds, often outlined with Border Gray, indicating active or hover states. Helvetica 15px, weight 400 is used.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Canvas White (#ffffff) as the default background for all page surfaces and major content blocks.
- Implement Text Black (#1c1c1c) for all primary text, headings, and functional icons to maintain high contrast.
- Apply Border Gray (#e5e7eb) for all hairline separators, subtle outlines, and inactive interactive component borders.
- Utilize 9999px border-radius for all pill-shaped buttons and tags, creating a soft, approachable boundary.
- Maintain a compact typographical rhythm with Helvetica (or system-ui sans-serif substitute) at a letter-spacing of -0.025em for all prominent text.
- Adhere to an 8px base unit for horizontal spacing between elements and 4px for fine-tuned vertical padding.

### Don't
- Avoid introducing additional saturated colors unless explicitly for semantic states (e.g., error) or specific brand-approved product imagery, as the system is intentionally achromatic.
- Do not use heavy shadows or deeply colored backgrounds; surface elevation should be minimal and almost imperceptible, achieved through subtle borders where needed.
- Refrain from using large, decorative typefaces for headlines; the system prioritizes compact, functional typography.
- Do not deviate from the established border-radius values (9999px for buttons/tags, 15px for inputs); arbitrary rounded corners will disrupt the system's feel.
- Avoid excessive padding around interface elements; the site employs a compact density, maximizing information visibility.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Canvas White | `#ffffff` | Primary page background and content areas |
| 2 | Border Gray | `#e5e7eb` | Subtle visual separation for lists and card-like elements |

## Imagery
The visual language relies heavily on product-focused photography and vibrant book cover art. Photography either features clean, high-key shots of books and products isolated on simple backgrounds (e.g., solid color blocks). Images are contained within rectangular frames, with no overlapping or complex masking. They are highly central to content, serving as both decorative atmosphere and explanatory content, occupying significant visual space in grid layouts.

## Layout
The page maintains a full-width, non-contained layout, allowing content to stretch across the browser window. The hero section features a dynamic, full-bleed split visual with two large product images. Content is primarily arranged in a dense, multi-column grid for product listings, with consistent vertical spacing between sections. Navigation is minimalist, residing in a lightweight top bar that appears fixed on scroll.
