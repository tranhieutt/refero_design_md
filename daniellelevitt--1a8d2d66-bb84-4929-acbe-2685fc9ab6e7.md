Daniellelevitt embraces an expressive, art-forward visual system pairing bold, high-contrast typography with a vibrant, playful color palette. The primary canvas shifts dramatically between an intense, almost acidic green and stark white, serving as a dynamic backdrop for overlaid photography and minimalist text. Typography is a dominant visual element, oversized and often cropped, creating a sense of dramatic scale and artistic edge. Components are lightweight and almost invisible, letting the visual content and distinctive typography define the aesthetic.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orange Peel | `#d15022` | `--color-orange-peel` | Brand accent for interactive elements, headlines, and key text highlighting. Its vividness provides a striking contrast against both the White Canvas and Mint Canvas |
| Mint Canvas | `#75dfb5` | `--color-mint-canvas` | Dominant background color for sections, creating a distinctive and energetic brand presence. Also used for text backgrounds to visually separate content |
| Midnight Ink | `#000000` | `--color-midnight-ink` | Dark borders and separators for elevated surfaces and inverted UI. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Purple Haze | `#E676B6` | `--color-purple-haze` | Decorative color, likely for specific branding elements or accents, derived from `--logo-color` |

## Components

### Text Link
**Role:** Standard interactive link for navigation and inline references.
Text uses 'Orange Peel' (`#d15022`) with no underline by default. On hover, it maintains the color, often appearing within contexts like the main navigation or content references. Some links also use 'Midnight Ink' (`#000000`) for text.

### Ghost Button
**Role:** Minimalist button with text acting as the primary visual. Used for navigation and calls to action.
Text is 'Orange Peel' (`#d15022`), size `10px`, weight `800`, letter-spacing `-0.01em` from 'Helvetica Now Display'. It has `0px` radius, `0px` padding, and a transparent background. A thin 'Orange Peel' border appears on interaction or for emphasis, providing definition without heavy styling.

### Minimal Navigation Link
**Role:** Top-level navigation items.
Text is 'Orange Peel' (`#d15022`) for active items or 'Midnight Ink' (`#000000`) for other menu items, using 'Helvetica Now Display' at `10px` and `800` weight, with `20px` right and left padding. These links often function graphically as part of the overall page layout.

### Content Card (Image)
**Role:** Displays visual content within dynamic layouts.
Images are often framed with a 'Midnight Ink' (`#000000`) border and `0px` radius, creating clear visual separation from the background. No explicit padding is applied to the image itself, allowing it to sit flush with its container.

### Background Block (Mint)
**Role:** Large, distinct sections of content.
A full-width block with a 'Mint Canvas' (`#75dfb5`) background. Text within these blocks typically uses 'Orange Peel' (`#d15022`) for contrast, often with large 'Helvetica Now Display Condensed' headlines.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use 'Orange Peel' (`#d15022`) for all interactive text elements and primary calls to action, maintaining its vividness.
- Set the main canvas background either to pure white or 'Mint Canvas' (`#75dfb5`), alternating between sections to create visual rhythm.
- Apply 'Helvetica Now Display' (weight 800) for all body copy and standard navigation at `10px` and `18px`, ensuring a consistent energetic textual presence.
- Employ oversized 'Helvetica Now Display Condensed' (weight 800, `72px`) for headlines, allowing it to stretch and often break out of standard text flow.
- Frame images and content blocks with a `0px` radius and a 'Midnight Ink' (`#000000`) border to give structure without softening the visual edge.
- Use `20px` as the standard `elementGap` between diverse content elements and `50px` for `sectionGap` to manage vertical rhythm.
- Maintain a `0px` border-radius for all components and elements, aligning with the sharp, unyielding aesthetic.

### Don't
- Avoid soft shadows or subtle elevation; the design system relies on flat planes and strong color contrast for depth.
- Do not use generic system fonts; always prioritize 'Helvetica Now Display' and 'Helvetica Now Display Condensed' to maintain brand identity.
- Refrain from using subdued or desaturated colors for primary elements; the system thrives on bold, high-chroma statements.
- Do not introduce padding or rounded corners on buttons or cards; maintain a crisp, minimalist interaction style.
- Avoid complex layouts that obscure the photography or dominant typography; prioritize clear, often dramatic, presentation of visual assets.

## Imagery
The visual language is dominated by high-impact photography, primarily portraits and fashion/editorial shots, used in a full-bleed or contained, square/rectangular, unmasked format. Graphics are minimal, often manifested as oversized, cropped typography that functions as a graphic element itself. Images are treated realistically, with natural color palettes and varied lighting, from studio shots to outdoor scenes, emphasizing the subject. Iconography is text-based ('D-L', 'Menu') or omitted. Images are the primary content, with text playing a supporting or complementary graphic role, resulting in an image-heavy, visually dense experience.

## Layout
The layout is flexible and dynamic, with sections that often shift between a full-bleed white canvas and an equally full-bleed 'Mint Canvas' background. The hero section displays a collage of irregularly placed, framed images over a white background, with oversized, dynamically rendered brand typography ('Danielle Levitt') serving as a central graphic element. Subsequent sections can feature a full-bleed 'Mint Canvas' background with centered headlines and descriptive text and then return to an image-focused or text-over-image layout. There's no fixed max-width, allowing content to stretch across the viewport. Navigation is minimal, consisting of 'D-L' (logo) and 'Menu' aligned to the top corners.

Quick Color Reference:
text: #000000
background: #75dfb5
border: #000000
accent: #d15022
primary action: #d15022 (outlined action border)

Example Component Prompts:
Create a hero section with 'Danielle Levitt' as the main graphic headline: Use Helvetica Now Display Condensed at 72px, weight 800, letter-spacing -0.01em, Orange Peel #d15022. Position it centrally as an oversized graphic. Place a 'Midnight Ink' #000000 text link 'Menu' in the top right. Overlay various images with 'Midnight Ink' colored borders.

Create a descriptive text block on a 'Mint Canvas' background: Set background to #75dfb5. The main descriptive text should be 'Orange Peel' #d15022, Helvetica Now Display, 18px, weight 800, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing -0.01em. Provide `50px` of vertical `sectionGap` before and after.

Generate an interactive navigation element: Use 'Midnight Ink' #000000 text, Helvetica Now Display, 10px, weight 800, letter-spacing -0.01em. Add `20px` of padding on the right and left, and no border-radius. For active state, use 'Orange Peel' #d15022 as text color.
