Dash Digital Studio employs a stark and confident design language, built on a monochromatic palette of industrial grays and pure black. Typography is sharp and impactful, leveraging precise letter-spacing to create a sense of focused clarity. The layout is disciplined, using robust hairline borders to define content blocks, and relies on subtle motion and confident imagery over color to convey a sense of premium precision.

## Components

### Ghost Nav Link
**Role:** Navigation item and secondary calls to action
Text in Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) with Founders Grotesk weight 400 at 16px, line-height 1, and no explicit padding, indicating actions inline with text.

### Text Accent Button
**Role:** Outlined textual action prompts, typically for 'View Case Study' or 'More +' links
Text label in Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) with Founders Grotesk. No background, transparent padding, and typically has a bottom border in Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) at 1px thickness to indicate interactivity.

### Project Card
**Role:** Displays individual portfolio projects or featured content.
A minimalist container with no background color, no border radius, and no padding, relying on surrounding layout to define its boundaries. Text is Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) at 14px Founders Grotesk weight 400 for categories, and headings in Midnight Ink (#000000) at 22px Founders Grotesk weight 400.

### Information Block Card
**Role:** Structured content blocks, such as client testimonials or service descriptions.
A transparent card with no border radius or shadow, featuring a strong 1px border in Midnight Ink (#000000) for visual separation. Internal padding is approximately 29px left/right and 20px top/bottom, with content text in Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) using Founders Grotesk font at 16px.

### Pill Badge
**Role:** Small, descriptive labels or navigational markers.
Features a 999px border-radius, creating a pill shape. Background is transparent with text in Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) or Midnight Ink (#000000) using Founders Grotesk at 12px or 14px, with minimal padding (e.g., 4px).

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize Founders Grotesk for all primary textual content and UI, defaulting to weight 400 for body text and 300 for large headings.
- Use a monochromatic palette concentrating on Storm Canvas (#f0f0f0) for backgrounds, Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) for most text and borders, and Midnight Ink (#000000) for strong headings and dividers.
- Employ consistent 1px hairline borders for clear delineation of sections and content blocks, primarily in Carbon Text (#2a2a2a) or Midnight Ink (#000000).
- Apply specific negative letter-spacing values to Founders Grotesk headings (-0.03em for 40px, -0.023em for 70px, -0.018em for 101px) to maintain visual tightness.
- Structure layouts using a max-width of 1200px centered on the page, with a consistent section gap of 115px.
- Utilize a precise 999px border-radius for pill-shaped elements like badges and tags, maintaining crisp, sharp corners for all other components.
- Integrate subtle transform and opacity transitions with `ease` timing functions over 1s for interactive elements to create a responsive, fluid feel.

### Don't
- Avoid introducing any new chromatic colors; maintain the gray-scale and black-and-white aesthetic.
- Do not use generic border-radii; adhere strictly to 0px for most elements and 999px for specific pill-like components.
- Refrain from using drop shadows or heavy box-shadows; the design relies on stark contrast and borders for depth.
- Do not use body text larger than 17px or smaller than 12px for primary content; maintain the established type hierarchy.
- Avoid unnecessary padding or excessive white space within components; maintain a comfortable, not overly sparse, density.
- Do not use generic sans-serif system fonts as primary typography; Founders Grotesk is key to the brand's voice.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Storm Canvas | `#f0f0f0` | Primary page background |
| 1 | Cloud Gray | `#fafafa` | Elevated card surface, subtle content blocks |
| 2 | Slate Divider | `#d6d6d6` | Background for less prominent areas or subtle separation |

## Imagery
This site features highly stylized, editorial photography and product shots. Images are typically contained within strict rectangular frames (0px radius), either full-width within their columns or slightly off-set. Product shots are often tight, focused crops, sometimes isolated on a neutral background or with dramatic lighting to create visual interest. There is a strong emphasis on showcasing the 'work' itself, without much lifestyle context. Photography is high-contrast, with deep blacks and bright whites, and sometimes a moody or dramatic tone. Icons are generally minimal, outlined, and monochromatic, matching the overall stark aesthetic. Imagery plays a content-dominant and aesthetic role, providing visual richness within a formally structured layout.

## Layout
The site employs a max-width, center-aligned layout of 1200px. The hero section is full-width, utilizing a dark background with a large, centered headline and a subtle subtext. Content sections primarily follow a consistent vertical rhythm with alternating light/gray backgrounds. Most content is presented in a two-column grid, often with text on one side and an image or illustrative graphic on the other, creating a clean left-right visual rhythm. Feature and client sections adapt to multi-column card grids, where each card is visually distinct, often bordered. Navigation is a sticky top bar with a minimal brand logo and a 'Menu +' toggle for expanding a full-screen menu. The overall density is comfortable, with ample whitespace balancing content blocks.
