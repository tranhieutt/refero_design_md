Dul Zorigoo's design system evokes an organized, understated workspace with strong typographic presence. It uses a near-monochromatic palette where all interface elements exist within a narrow range of grays, allowing content to take visual precedence. Interactions are subtle, marked by soft borders and minimal spatial shifts rather than vivid color, creating a quiet, focused user experience.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | `#ffffff` | `--color-canvas` | Page backgrounds, card surfaces, UI canvases |
| Tarmac | `#252525` | `--color-tarmac` | Primary text, prominent headings, strong link text. High contrast against light surfaces |
| Fog | `#ebebeb` | `--color-fog` | Subtle borders, dividers, ghost button outlines. Provides soft definition between elements |
| Asphalt | `#a8a8a8` | `--color-asphalt` | Secondary text, muted headings, captions. A softer alternative to Tarmac for subordinate information |
| Pebble | `#8e8e8e` | `--color-pebble` | Muted helper text, tertiary information. Fades into the background for low-priority content |
| Midnight | `#000000` | `--color-midnight` | Supporting palette color for small decorative accents when the core palette needs contrast. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Ivory | `#fbfbfb` | `--color-ivory` | Text color on Midnight backgrounds |

## Components

### Ghost Filter Button
**Role:** Used for navigation and filtering categories
Text in Tarmac (#252525) on a transparent background with no padding. Interacts subtly through hover/active states. Border is set to `0px`.

### Pill Filter Button
**Role:** Used for navigation and filtering categories
Text in Tarmac (#252525) on a transparent background, 8px padding applied horizontally (paddingRight/Left) and 0px vertically, with a border-radius of 8px. Border `1px` solid, Fog (#ebebeb).

### Active Pill Button
**Role:** Indicates the currently selected filter or category.
Text in Ivory (#fbfbfb) on a Midnight (#000000) background, 8px padding horizontally, 0px vertically, with a border-radius of 8px. Used sparingly for strong accent.

### Thumbnail Card
**Role:** Displays content previews, typically an image with a text label below.
Acts as a container for visual content. Implicit padding for internal elements, likely using the base element gap of 6px. No explicit border-radius on the card itself, but contained interactive elements (buttons/links) have a radius of 8px.

### Subtle Link
**Role:** Standard inline links and navigation items within sidebars.
Text Tarmac (#252525) with no explicit decoration. Distinguished by minimal horizontal padding of 8px and a radius of 8px for interactive areas or hover states. Border `1px` solid, Fog (#ebebeb).

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize Tarmac (#252525) for all primary text and headings.
- Use Canvas (#ffffff) for all main backgrounds and surface elements.
- Define separation with Fog (#ebebeb) for subtle borders and dividers.
- Apply an 8px border-radius to all interactive elements like buttons and links.
- Use Midnight (#000000) and Ivory (#fbfbfb) exclusively for primary active button states.
- Maintain a conservative use of spacing, adhering to 6px for element gaps and 32px for section separation.

### Don't
- Avoid using saturated or vivid colors; the palette is strictly achromatic with very limited exceptions.
- Do not introduce strong shadows or excessive elevation; the design relies on flat surfaces and subtle borders.
- Do not use multiple font families; all typography should adhere to the singular, strong typographic voice.
- Avoid large, decorative headings; headlines are typically concise and integrated into the content flow.
- Do not apply padding or margins that significantly deviate from the established 4px base unit or token values.
- Do not use `0px` border-radius for interactive elements unless it's a specific ghost button variant.

## Imagery
This system primarily uses static photography and product UI screenshots. Photography ranges from evocative black & white landscapes to slightly desaturated color images, often cropped tightly or presented within contained frames. UI screenshots are functional and explanatory, blending seamlessly into the monochromatic design. Imagery serves a decorative and illustrative role, providing context and visual interest without overwhelming the clean interface. Icons, where present, are minimal, outlined, and monochromatic, typically in Tarmac (#252525).

## Layout
The page uses a maximum content width of 1137px, centrally aligned. The hero section is subtle, starting with text on the left and evolving into a grid of content. Content is arranged predominantly in a multi-column grid, often 2 or 3 columns, where visual elements (photos/screenshots) are paired with text labels below. Vertical rhythm is established through consistent 32px section gaps and smaller 6px element gaps. Navigation is sidebar-based, with current status highlighted by small borders, complemented by horizontal filter buttons above content areas.
