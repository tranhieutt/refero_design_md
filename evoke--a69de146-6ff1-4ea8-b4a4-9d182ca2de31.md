EVOKE presents a bold, high-contrast visual system where stark black and white typography dominates an otherwise colorful, illustrative landscape. The design prioritizes readability and impact through large, heavy type set against vibrant, interchangeable background panels, creating a dynamic, almost billboard-like presentation. Visual content is presented in distinct, contained blocks, allowing each piece to stand out. Spacing is comfortable, offering breathing room for the strong visual elements without feeling sparse.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Midnight Ink | `#000000` | `--color-midnight-ink` | Dark borders and separators for elevated surfaces and inverted UI. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Canvas White | `#ffffff` | `--color-canvas-white` | Content backgrounds, contrasting text against dark backgrounds. Serves as a neutral canvas or a high-contrast foreground |
| Rosy Flush | `#ff5a46` | `--color-rosy-flush` | Dominant background color, often paired with black text for key sections |
| Sunbeam Yellow | `#ffe100` | `--color-sunbeam-yellow` | Background panels for featured content, providing a bright, energetic lift |
| Sky Cyan | `#00ffff` | `--color-sky-cyan` | Accent background for visual sections, creating a cool, modern backdrop |
| Lavender Mist | `#ebebf5` | `--color-lavender-mist` | Subtle background for panels, offering a softer alternative to the more vivid brand colors |

## Components

### Accent Background Section
**Role:** Containers for visual content or key information.
These sections feature full-bleed background colors (Rosy Flush, Sunbeam Yellow, Sky Cyan, Lavender Mist) without rounded corners, providing a distinct canvas for contained imagery or large typography. Content within these sections uses 21px padding.

### Image Card with 'VIEW' Overlay
**Role:** Showcasing portfolio items or visual content.
A square image container. On hover, a semantically full-bleed overlay appears with the word 'VIEW' in Canvas White (#ffffff) using tt_norms_proextrablack at 31px, line-height 1.2, letter-spacing -0.0150em, with a Midnight Ink (#000000) border, 88px wide. The default state has no visible border.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize high-contrast text against solid, vibrant background colors. For example, Midnight Ink (#000000) text on Rosy Flush (#ff5a46).
- Utilize tt_norms_proextrablack (substitute Bebas Neue) at 31px, line-height 1.2, and tight letter-spacing (-0.0150em) for all impactful display text and brand statements.
- Present visual content within distinct, full-bleed color sections using Rosy Flush (#ff5a46), Sunbeam Yellow (#ffe100), Sky Cyan (#00ffff), or Lavender Mist (#ebebf5) as background colors.
- Ensure all interactive elements and image borders clearly use Midnight Ink (#000000) for definition with a sharp, 0px border-radius.
- Apply 21px interior padding consistently to content blocks within colored sections to provide comfortable spacing from edges.
- Maintain a comfortable element gap of 20px between distinct visual components and text blocks for clear separation.

### Don't
- Avoid gradients or complex background textures; the system relies on flat, bold color blocks.
- Do not introduce rounded corners; all elements, including images and containers, should maintain sharp, 0px edges.
- Refrain from using subtle or low-contrast color pairings; the core aesthetic is built on strong, immediate visual impact.
- Do not deviate from the specified tight letter-spacing for headings; it is crucial to the typographic identity.
- Avoid unnecessary icons or decorative flourishes; maintain a minimalist approach that spotlights typography and content.
- Do not embed imagery with soft edges or complex masking; images should be contained and rectilinear.
- Do not use generic system fonts for display text; stick to tt_norms_pro family (or substitutes) for brand consistency.

## Imagery
The site uses a mix of high-quality lifestyle photography and abstract, colorful flat illustrations. Photography is generally unedited or naturally lit, focusing on people interacting with products or environments, contained within square aspect ratios. Illustrations are abstract, geometric, and vibrant, using the core brand color palette to create distinct scenes or abstract shapes. Iconography is minimalist, outlined, and monochromatic, visible as a 'book' icon within a white square overlay. Imagery primarily serves as portfolio showcase and decorative atmosphere, arranged in a grid-like fashion.

## Layout
The page exhibits a full-bleed layout, where content sections stretch across the entire viewport width. The hero section and subsequent content blocks frequently use distinct, solid background colors that fill the screen. Content within these sections often appears to be centered or arranged in a grid for visual projects. There's a strong emphasis on consistent vertical rhythm, with ample space between and around content blocks, creating a comfortable yet impactful presentation. Navigation appears minimal, implied by the 'VIEW' overlays on image blocks rather than a persistent header or sidebar.
