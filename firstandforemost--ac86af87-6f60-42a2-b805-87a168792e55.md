First + Foremost casts a vibrant, modern tone through the interplay of a single bold orange and off-white neutrals. Typography is large and declarative, often acting as a primary visual element. The layout is spacious with strong rectangular sections, allowing content to breathe and emphasizing the punchy color contrast. Components use soft rounding for buttons against typically sharp-edged backgrounds, creating an approachable yet direct aesthetic.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize Amber Blaze (#ff4501) for significant background sections and primary interactive elements to maintain visual energy.
- Use Vanilla Cream (#ffefe9) as the default background color for content sections for optimal readability and a warm base.
- Employ NeueMontreal at its full display sizes (58, 80, 200px) with appropriate line heights (1.0, 0.8) for impactful headlines.
- Apply 80px border-radius to all filled buttons to achieve a consistent pill-shaped aesthetic.
- Maintain spacious layouts: use 160px for section vertical gaps and 72px for horizontal content margins (left/right).
- Use Obsidian Ink (#000000) for all body text and general UI text against Vanilla Cream (#ffefe9) background.

### Don't
- Do not introduce additional bold chromatic colors beyond Amber Blaze (#ff4501); rely on its contrast with neutrals.
- Avoid tight spacing: do not use vertical gaps less than 30px between textual elements or less than 50px between sections.
- Do not use subtle variations of orange for text; text links should be Amber Blaze (#ff4501).
- Avoid heavy shadows for elevation; rely on color contrast and subtle borders like Dusty Rose (#ffc2a9) for separation.
- Do not use square buttons; maintain consistency with the 80px border-radius for all primary/secondary actions.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Vanilla Cream Canvas | `#ffefe9` | Primary page background and foundational surface |
| 1 | Amber Blaze Surface | `#ff4501` | Prominent background sections, acting as a vibrant canvas for inverted text |
| 2 | Arctic Mist Card | `#ffffff` | Secondary background for components like buttons or internal cards within Amber Blaze sections |

## Imagery
The visual language for imagery is primarily line-art illustrations in a warm tone, used decoratively. When present, images are often full-width or large blocks, sometimes outlined with a subtle border in Dusty Rose (#ffc2a9). Photography for team members is product-focused, small, circular, and isolated against a vibrant Amber Blaze (#ff4501) background. Icons are monochromatic, using Obsidian Ink (#000000) fill. Imagery serves a decorative and atmospheric role, rather than direct product showcase.

## Layout
The page uses a full-bleed layout, where content sections often extend to the edge of the viewport. The hero section features large, bold typography centered over a background that shifts between high-contrast Amber Blaze and soft Vanilla Cream, often integrating line art. Section rhythm is distinctly separated, often employing large vertical gaps (160px) and sometimes featuring a thin Dusty Rose (#ffc2a9) border. Content arrangement frequently uses centered text blocks or large text elements, occasionally paired with small circular imagery. Navigation is a minimalist top bar with text links.
