The Rou Hun Fan design system is a high-contrast, text-dominant interface built around a dark canvas punctuated by neon accents and an unconventional typographic play. It combines bold, blocky sans-serifs with ornate serifs, creating a distinct visual language that feels energetic and disruptive. The layout emphasizes direct and impactful messaging, using minimal interactive elements to draw attention to stark color contrasts and unique typography.

## Components

### Primary Navigation Link
**Role:** Top-level navigation items.
White text (#ffffff) using Azeret Mono, weight 700 with an underline on hover (not present in raw data, but standard behavior).

### Hero Headline Block
**Role:** Main page title or section headline.
Large text using Azeret Mono, weight 700, size 100px, color Ghost White (#ffffff), on a Midnight Charcoal (#161b1b) background.

### Accent Content Box (Aqua Glow)
**Role:** Highlighting a key message or interactive area.
A rectangular block with an Aqua Glow (#00ffff) background, containing text in Electric Pink (#e82f5c) for main messages and Ghost White (#ffffff) for supporting text that is small and precise. Features an irregular, fragmented visual accent in Electric Pink (#e82f5c) and Violet Streak (#b333b3).

### Accent Content Box (Vermilion Red)
**Role:** Highlighting high-impact calls to action or interactive features.
A rectangular block with a Vermilion Red (#ff0000) background, containing text in Ghost White (#ffffff) and decorated with an ornate text overlay using Ephidona font. Used for the prominent 'Problem Studio' section.

### Decorative Section Title
**Role:** Stylized section headings.
Large Ephidona text, weight 400, size 100px or 108px, color Ghost White (#ffffff). These headings are art pieces more than functional labels.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize high contrast between foreground and background colors; use Ghost White (#ffffff) on Midnight Charcoal (#161b1b) and Vermilion Red (#ff0000) or Aqua Glow (#00ffff).
- Employ Azeret Mono, weight 700, for all primary headings and impactful statements at sizes 100px or larger.
- Use geometric lines and sharp corners; avoid rounded borders as the primary radius is 0px.
- Introduce elements using the Vermilion Red (#ff0000) or Aqua Glow (#00ffff) backgrounds to create distinct interactive zones or visual breaks.
- Treat Ephidona font (size 100-108px) as a decorative accent for section titles or artistic statements, not for body copy or functional text.
- Maintain a compact element spacing of 9px to keep components tightly grouped, reflecting a high-density aesthetic.

### Don't
- Do not use subtle color variations for backgrounds; keep a stark contrast between Midnight Charcoal (#161b1b) and Ghost White (#ffffff) or the vibrant accent colors.
- Avoid generic line heights or letter spacing; stick to the normal letter spacing and 1.2 lineHeight for existing typefaces.
- Do not use soft shadows or gradients for elevation; the system relies on flat color blocks and visual overlap for depth.
- Do not apply subtle typography; if text isn't a headline using Azeret Mono or Ephidona, it should be a functional, small detail.
- Do not use standard button components; interactive elements are expressed through high-contrast colored blocks with unique text styles.
- Do not add extra padding or whitespace around core elements without clear design intent; the density is inherently high.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Midnight Charcoal Canvas | `#161b1b` | The foundational page background for most content, offering a deep, dark base. |
| 1 | Vermilion Red Accent Surface | `#ff0000` | Used for prominent content blocks or interactive regions, creating a high-energy contrast against the charcoal background. |
| 2 | Aqua Glow Accent Surface | `#00ffff` | Secondary accent surface for key features or showcase content, providing a cool, vibrant counterpoint to the Vermilion Red. |

## Imagery
The site uses minimal photography, mainly tight, waist-up portrait crops on dark or neutral backgrounds, focusing on the subject's expression without props or complex settings. Imagery serves a direct biographical or personal branding role. Icons are implied to be text-based or minimal, outlined elements (e.g., LI, X links). There are abstract, geometric, jagged graphic accents, often in Electric Pink and Violet Streak on solid color blocks, serving as dynamic decorative flourishes.

## Layout
The page maintains a max-width of 1100px, centering content within the dark canvas. The hero features bold, centered headline text over a dark background. Sections are distinct, marked by large, impactful typographic elements and occasional full-width color blocks (Vermilion Red, Aqua Glow) that break the visual rhythm. Content structure leans heavily on stacked, centered elements with asymmetrical overlays of accent blocks (like the Aqua Glow box intruding on the main text area). A clear, minimal top navigation ('Rou Hun Fan' as a text-based, high-contrast link) and a concise text-based footer establish a boundary for content.
