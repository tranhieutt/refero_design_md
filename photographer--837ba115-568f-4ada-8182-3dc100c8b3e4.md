Julia Johnson's design system screams 'Bold Portfolio, Ever-Shifting Canvas'. The visual identity is defined by highly contrasted imagery against a minimalist, almost stark background that frequently changes hue, making each section a distinct visual statement. Typography is aggressive and direct, using a single dominant font at high weights for immediate impact. The layout prioritizes large-scale images and maximal, fluid areas of color, creating a dynamic and immersive gallery experience where the content itself dictates the mood and palette.

## Tokens - Typography

### Helvetica - Primary UI text for menus, links, and button labels â its condensed, heavy weight provides maximum impact even at small sizes. - `--font-helvetica`
- **Substitute:** Arial
- **Weights:** 700
- **Sizes:** 10px, 18px
- **Line height:** 1.00
- **Letter spacing:** -0.0200em
- **Role:** Primary UI text for menus, links, and button labels â its condensed, heavy weight provides maximum impact even at small sizes.

## Tokens - Spacing & Shapes

- **Section gap:** 43px
- **Card padding:** 0px
- **Element gap:** 15px

### Border Radius

| Element | Value |
|---|---|
| buttons | 0px |

## Components

### Ghost Menu Button
**Role:** Navigation trigger
Invisible button with an implied presence. When active, it uses Black Ink for its border and text. `backgroundColor: rgb(0,0,0)`, `color: rgb(0,0,0)`, `borderColor: rgb(0,0,0)`, `borderRadius: 0px`, `padding: 0px`.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use color washes from the 'brand' group as full-bleed section backgrounds, allowing one color to dominate a visual segment.
- Apply Black Ink (#000000) for all text and interactive element borders to maintain high contrast against varied backgrounds.
- Ensure all text, navigation, and menu items use Helvetica weight 700 at either 10px or 18px with -0.0200em letter spacing.
- Structure pages with a spacious feel, allowing large, uninterrupted blocks of color and imagery to dictate visual separation.
- Utilize the full page width without max-width constraints, allowing imagery and color to extend to the viewport edges.
- Frame all interactive elements and buttons with a 0px border radius for a sharp, angular aesthetic.

### Don't
- Avoid using multiple chromatic colors within a single background section; stick to one dominant brand color per area.
- Do not introduce any border radii on buttons or interactive elements; maintain a strictly angular design.
- Never use text weights other than 700 (bold) for UI elements; text should always feel strong and direct.
- Do not constrain content to a fixed max-width; let the layout breathe to the edges of the screen.
- Avoid subtle gradients or soft shadows; the system relies on stark contrasts and flat, vibrant color fields.

## Imagery
The visual language is purely photographic and highly editorial, featuring high-quality portraiture and fashion shots. Images are full-bleed or large blocks, often without borders or explicit framing, creating an immersive, gallery-like experience. The treatment is direct and unvarnished, focusing on the subject within its environment. There's an absence of abstract graphics or typical icons; UI elements are minimal, allowing the photography to be the primary visual content. Imagery dominates the visual space, minimizing accompanying text.

## Layout
The page model is full-bleed, with content extending to the edges of the viewport without a `max-width` container. The hero area often appears as a large, impactful photograph that sets the immediate tone. Section rhythm is created through abrupt shifts in background color, acting as distinct visual breaks rather than using traditional dividers or consistent vertical spacing. Content is arranged in alternating visual experiences, often one large image or a block of solid color per section. There's no visible grid system for organizing content, rather a free-flowing, asymmetrical composition that prioritizes individual visual statements. The density is spacious, allowing each image or color block ample room. Navigation is minimal, typically a small menu icon in a fixed corner, preserving the canvas for the main content.

## Agent Prompt Guide

Quick Color Reference:
text: #000000
background: #f2572c (or other brand colors)
border: #000000
accent: #f2572c
primary action: #e21715 (outlined action border)

Example Component Prompts:
1. Create a navigation menu: Black Ink (#000000) text, Helvetica weight 700 at 18px, letter-spacing -0.0200em. Positioned against a full-bleed #f2572c background.
2. Design a ghost button for a menu: Text 'Menu', Black Ink (#000000) for color and border, no background, 0px border radius, Helvetica weight 700 at 10px, letter-spacing -0.0200em.
3. Implement a section with an Inferno Red (#e21715) background: Text in Black Ink (#000000), Helvetica weight 700 at 18px. The section should span the full viewport width and be visually separated from the next section purely by color change.
