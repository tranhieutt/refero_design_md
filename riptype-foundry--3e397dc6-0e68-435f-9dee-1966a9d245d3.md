Riptype's design system combines a deep, almost black, background with crisp white typography and sparse, vivid chartreuse accents, creating a high-contrast, edgy aesthetic. Components are compact and minimally decorated, favoring subtle borders over heavy fills or shadows. The overall impression is technical and precise, reflecting its typographic focus. Subtle motion and interaction states provide a responsive, engaging user experience.

## Components

### Pill Accent Button
**Role:** Primary action button, often for CTAs or key navigation.
Rounded button with `Midnight Ink` background, `Charger Green` text and a `144px` border radius. Padding is `8px` vertical and `10-12px` horizontal. Subtle `1px` border of `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` on top edge.

### Standard Button
**Role:** Secondary action button for general interactivity.
Rectangular button with `Obsidian` background, `Frost` text, and `4px` border radius. Padding is `8px` vertical and `12px` horizontal. Subtle `1px` border of `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` on top edge.

### Menu Item Card
**Role:** Interactive list items, used in navigational menus.
Transparent background, `0px` border radius, no box shadow, with implied interactive states. Text color is `Frost` or `Pale Ash` for inactive states.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use `Midnight Ink` (#121212) as the dominant background color for all page sections.
- Prioritize `Frost` (#ffffff) for primary text and `Pale Ash` (#d0d0d0) for secondary text to maintain clear hierarchy against dark backgrounds.
- Apply `Charger Green` (#d9ff00) exclusively for highly interactive elements, text, and icons to draw attention and indicate action.
- Construct buttons with either `144px` (pill) or `4px` (standard) border radius, avoiding other radius values for interactive elements.
- Implement `6px` as the base unit for vertical and horizontal spacing between elements.
- Utilize the `Office` typeface across all headings and body text, adhering to the specified weights and precise letter-spacing values.

### Don't
- Avoid introducing additional saturated colors; maintain the high-contrast `Charger Green` (#d9ff00) as the sole vivid accent.
- Do not use heavy shadows or gradients for elevation; rely on subtle background opacity changes and thin borders.
- Do not create components with border radii other than `4px` or `144px` for interactive elements.
- Do not vary from the established `Midnight Ink` (#121212) and `Obsidian` (#292929) for background surfaces.
- Avoid large, uncontained imagery; all visuals should either be full-bleed with strong composition or tightly integrated into structured sections.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Canvas | `#121212` | The foundational background for the entire page and most primary content blocks. |
| 2 | Surface | `#292929` | A slightly lighter dark background used for secondary interactive elements like buttons, providing a subtle visual lift. |
| 3 | Glass Overlay | `#18181866` | Transparent, blurred overlay for potential modals or ephemeral UI elements, hinting at depth without heavy shadows. |

## Imagery
This system primarily uses bold, high-contrast, full-bleed graphic imagery and abstract product shots, often with a stark black backdrop. Photography, when present, features tightly cropped product details with high textural fidelity or stylized, almost conceptual images. Icons are minimalist, outlined, and monochromatic, often using `Frost` (#ffffff) or `Charger Green` (#d9ff00) for active states. The visual language favors an atmosphere of technical precision and artistic expression rather than lifestyle or extensive explanatory graphics. Imagery is heavy, commanding significant visual space.

## Layout
The page structure favors a max-width contained layout at `285px` for content, creating a focused, almost terminal-like experience. The hero section is full-bleed, often with a large, striking graphic or textural background and centered, bold typography. Subsequent sections maintain consistent vertical rhythm with minimal dividers, primarily using `6px` element gaps. The overall content arrangement alternates between left-aligned text blocks, centered feature displays, and grid-like presentations for items like font samples. Navigation is present as a minimal top bar and integrated sidebar list.

## Agent Prompt Guide

Quick Color Reference:
text: #ffffff
background: #121212
border: #d0d0d0
accent: #d9ff00
primary action: no distinct CTA color

Example Component Prompts:
No distinct primary action color was observed; use the extracted neutral button treatments instead of inventing a filled CTA color.
2. Design a feature card: `Midnight Ink` (#121212) background, `0px` border radius, with `Pale Ash` (#d0d0d0) 1px border. Inside, use `Frost` (#ffffff) for headlines (Office, 43px, weight 700) and `Pale Ash` (#d0d0d0) for body text (Office, 16px, weight 400).
3. Generate a secondary button: `Obsidian` (#292929) background, `Frost` (#ffffff) text, `4px` border radius, `8px` vertical padding, `12px` horizontal padding. Use `Office` font weight 400 at 16px.
