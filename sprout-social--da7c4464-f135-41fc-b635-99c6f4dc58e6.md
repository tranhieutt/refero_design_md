### Hero Input Field

### Navigation Link
**Role:** Navigation element
Inherits text color from parent context, typically Midnight Core or Canvas White. No background or padding. Hover states implied by color change or subtle underline.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize text legibility by ensuring Midnight Core (#040404) on Canvas White (#ffffff) backgrounds, and Canvas White on Midnight Core backgrounds.
- Use Olive Accent (#98e58e) exclusively for primary calls-to-action or key success indicators; avoid decorative use.
- Apply a 16px border-radius to all primary content cards and navigation containers to maintain a consistent soft edge.
- Maintain a comfortable rhythm with 'elementGap': 16px between most interactive elements and 'sectionGap': 32px between major content blocks.
- All headings should use Proxima Nova weight 700 or 800, carefully selecting corresponding sizes from the typescale to establish a clear hierarchy.
- Employ the rgba(39, 51, 51, 0.24) 0px 4px 8px 0px shadow sparingly, primarily for the sticky navigation, to indicate subtle elevation without visual clutter.
- Ensure input fields have a 1px Focus Silver (#cbcece) border and a 4px border-radius for clear definition and soft containment.

### Don't
- Do not introduce new chromatic colors outside of Olive Accent (#98e58e) for interactive elements.
- Avoid arbitrary changes in border-radius; adhere to 16px for cards, 6px for buttons/inputs, and 24px for badges.
- Do not use generic system fonts; only use Proxima Nova or its designated substitute.
- Do not use shadows on content cards directly; rely on background color changes for surface differentiation.
- Do not deviate from the established spacing units; avoid custom padding or margin values that aren't multiples of 4px.
- Avoid hero sections with busy imagery; prioritize gradients or a solid Midnight Core background to highlight text content and interactive elements.
- Do not use black (#000000) for primary text on default light backgrounds where Midnight Core (#040404) is available for better visual cohesion.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Midnight Core Canvas | `#040404` | Primary page background for main content areas and deep sections. |
| 1 | Canvas White Panel | `#ffffff` | Card backgrounds, main navigation, and prominent content blocks appearing on the Midnight Core Canvas. |

## Imagery
The visual language relies heavily on product UI screenshots and stylized workflow diagrams, which are embedded within soft-edged white cards or presented within the primary content area. When photography is used, it features high-key, professional, and slightly staged images of individuals interacting with technology, often with a clear focus on the user. Illustrations are dimensional and gradient-filled, avoiding hard outlines, featuring organic shapes that blend into backgrounds. Icons are minimal, either solid-filled or slightly outlined, often monochrome. Imagery serves an explanatory and product-showcasing role, rarely decorative atmosphere, and is generally contained within defined spaces rather than full-bleed.

## Layout
The page primarily uses a full-bleed structure with content often contained within a maximum width section, likely centered. The hero section is full-bleed with a dark background, featuring a prominent centered headline and input fields. Subsequent sections alternate between dark (Midnight Core) and light (Canvas White) backgrounds, creating a clear vertical rhythm. Content within sections is often arranged in multi-column layouts, such as two-column text-left/visual-right patterns or three-column card grids for features and integrations. Navigation is a fixed top bar on a Canvas White background, while the header itself is initially on Midnight Core. The overall density feels comfortable, providing ample breathing room around content blocks.
