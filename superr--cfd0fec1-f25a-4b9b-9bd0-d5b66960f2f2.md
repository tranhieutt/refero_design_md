Superr opts for a youthful, playful aesthetic, resembling a child's notebook brought to life. A warm, off-white canvas sets a friendly, approachable tone, punctuated by vibrant, primary-school-inspired colors for text highlights and playful borders. Typography leans into a handwritten, slightly uneven feel for headings, offset by a clean sans-serif for body copy. Components are light, favoring subtle shadows and rounded corners to maintain a soft, tactile presence, echoing the physical world of a notebook.

## Components

### Ghost Button

### Pill Ghost Button
**Role:** Call to action, primary interaction
Primary call to action button, appearing as a pill-shaped outline. Canvas Parchment background with Deep Graphite text. Border is a 1px solid Deep Graphite. Rounded with a 20px radius. Has a subtle shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.25) 0px 1px 2px 0px. Uses 4px vertical and 28px horizontal padding, with gelica font, 20px, weight 400.

### Elevated Card
**Role:** Content container, feature display
Used for grouping related content, such as features or testimonials. Canvas Parchment background with 12px border radius. Features a soft, distant shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06) 0px 2px 20px 0px. Internal padding is 24px top, 0px horizontal, 16px bottom.

### Navigation Link
**Role:** Primary navigation item
Links within the header or footer navigation. Uses Geist font at 18px, weight 400, in Deep Graphite. Underlined on hover or active state with a 1px Canvas Parchment border top, and a 2px Deep Graphite border bottom when hover/active. Minimal padding.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Canvas Parchment (#fdfbf9) as the dominant background color for all page sections and elevated surfaces.
- Apply the gelica font for all headings and prominent UI text (e.g., call to action buttons), embracing its playful, handwritten character.
- Employ rounded corners with a 12px radius for cards and containers, and a 20px radius for interactive elements like buttons.
- Introduce color selectively for emphasis, using Playful Red (#ce500a), Sky Blue (#3b82f6), Bubblegum Pink (#ff66cf), or Grass Green (#22c55e) for highlight text or decorative borders, never as primary backgrounds.
- Maintain comfortable spacing: 12px for small element gaps, 32px for card padding, and 64px for vertical section separation.
- Use a subtle soft shadow (rgba(0,0,0,0.06) 0px 2px 20px 0px) to give cards a gentle lift, avoiding heavy or stark elevation.
- For primary calls to action, use the Pill Ghost Button style with a Deep Graphite (#171717) stroke and text on the Canvas Parchment background.

### Don't
- Avoid using highly saturated brand colors as large background fills; they are intended for accents and highlights.
- Do not use sharp 0px corners on any UI elements; all corners should have some degree of rounding (minimum 2px).
- Refrain from heavy, multi-layered shadows; the design embraces a light, gentle elevation with a single, soft shadow.
- Do not use generic system fonts; always prioritize gelica for display and Geist for functional text.
- Avoid dense, information-heavy layouts; maintain ample white space and comfortable element spacing.
- Do not introduce strong, solid border colors unless they are part of a deliberate accent or interactive state (e.g. outline buttons).

## Imagery
Imagery primarily features stylized 3D product renders of SuperrBook notebooks with playful, illustrated stickers. The product shots are often cropped tightly or presented from an angle, showcasing the physical object with a sense of tactility. Illustrations are flat, geometric, and brand-colored, often appearing as small, whimsical floating elements or in sticker form on the product. Icons are mostly outlined, with a moderate stroke weight, carrying the brand's cheerful persona. The overall role of imagery is to be decorative and atmospheric, highlighting the product in an imaginative, content-rich way without overwhelming the UI, maintaining a text-dominant density.

## Layout
The page uses a full-bleed layout, allowing elements to span the entire viewport width, but content is often contained within an implicit central column, especially for text blocks. The hero section features a large, product illustration on the right, balanced by a significant headline and subtext on the left, creating an asymmetric but balanced composition. Sections follow a consistent vertical rhythm, often alternating between a main content block and a full-bleed decorative element (like the notebooks). Content is typically arranged in left-aligned stacks or two-column text-left/image-right patterns. There is no explicit grid for cards on the initial screen, but subsequent sections imply a flexible grid for features. Navigation is a minimal top-bar, sticky header design with a single interactive icon and a ghost button.
