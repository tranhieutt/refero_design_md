This system feels like a minimalist architectural blueprint, where products are spotlighted against a backdrop of muted industrial grays. The deliberate use of extremely thin custom typography, particularly for headings, creates a subtle, almost whispered authority. Interactive elements are marked by a singular vivid blue against a monochromatic field, acting like technical indicator lights. Sharp angles and high-contrast text on neutral surfaces define the system's precise and functional aesthetic.

Links within the footer use te-20 font, Steel (#e5e5e5) text color on a Graphite (#0f0e12) background.

### Promotional Banner (Top)

A triangular overlay with a yellow background, black border, and black text. Contains two functional buttons: 'settings' and 'accept all'. Black text on yellow background for readability.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize the ultra-light 'te-20' and 'te-40' typefaces, especially for headlines, to maintain the brand's understated authority.
- Use Electric Blue (#0071bb) exclusively for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Implement high-contrast pairings of Ink (#000000) text on Canvas (#f6f8f7) backgrounds for primary content.
- Define clear visual hierarchy through font weights (te-40 for main headings, te-20 for body and smaller elements), rather than size alone.
- Maintain generous spacing with 15px for element gaps and 66px for section gaps, contributing to the 'comfortable' density.
- Employ Steel (#e5e5e5) and Smoke (#b2b2b2) for subtle borders and muted text to provide visual structure without heavy lines.
- Leverage the Canvas (#f6f8f7) background as the primary stage, ensuring products and content remain the focal point.

### Don't
- Avoid using bold or heavy font weights for headlines; the brand identity is built on a whisper-thin typographic aesthetic.
- Do not introduce new vibrant colors outside of Electric Blue (#0071bb) for interactive elements, as this dilutes the monochromatic focus.
- Refrain from adding decorative shadows or complex embellishments; the design system favors clean, flat surfaces.
- Do not use Electric Blue (#0071bb) for non-interactive text or purely decorative elements, as it's reserved for action.
- Avoid excessive rounding of corners; the design system maintains sharp, precise edge treatments.
- Do not allow text to crowd; ensure ample 15px element spacing and 66px section padding is consistently applied.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Canvas | `#f6f8f7` | Primary page background, light canvases for product display. |
| 2 | Graphite | `#0f0e12` | Secondary background for navigation, footers, or sections intended to recede or provide contrast for lighter elements. |
| 3 | Ink | `#000000` | High-contrast background for specific elements or headers within darker sections, providing maximum textual legibility against lighter content. |

## Imagery
The visual language focuses heavily on product photography, presenting devices in a precise, almost clinical manner. Products are often isolated or shown in context against plain, industrial gray or white backgrounds, emphasizing their form and detailing. The style is primarily clean and contained, with sharp edges and no visible rounding. Photography is brightly lit, showcasing product textures and features clearly, avoiding lifestyle contexts. Icons are minimalist, outlined, and monochromatic, often using Steel (#e5e5e5) on darker backgrounds or Ink (#000000) on lighter ones, serving a functional and informational role.

## Layout
The page primarily utilizes a max-width contained layout with centered content, though the main navigation and the hero section can stretch full-bleed visually. The hero typically features a large product image, often against a dark or gray background, with minimal, centered text elements. Sections maintain a consistent vertical rhythm, often separated by distinct background shifts between Canvas (#f6f8f7) and a darker neutral. Content is arranged in alternating image-left, text-right, or vice-versa patterns, and product displays often use a simple, predictable grid. Navigation is a prominent, full-width top bar, generally sticky or highly visible, using a high-contrast ink-on-canvas or steel-on-graphite palette.

Example Component Prompts:
Create a product card for an item named 'EP-133 K.O. II'. The main text is 'EP-133 K.O. II' in te-20 weight 300 at 19px, color Ink (#000000). Below that, add a sub-text 'buy now' in te-20 weight 300 at 13px, color Electric Blue (#0071bb). The card background is Canvas (#f6f8f7) with 0px radius and a 1px border in Steel (#e5e5e5). Maintain an element gap of 15px between text elements.

Generate a dark navigation bar. Background is Graphite (#0f0e12). Links like 'products' are in te-20 weight 300 at 13px, color Steel (#e5e5e5). Icons are also color Steel (#e5e5e5). The navigation should be full-width with 66px padding on the sides.

Design a footer section. Background color Graphite (#0f0e12). All text links, such as 'newsletter' or 'contact', should be in te-20 weight 300 at 13px, color Steel (#e5e5e5). The footer has 33px padding top and bottom and 66px padding left and right.
