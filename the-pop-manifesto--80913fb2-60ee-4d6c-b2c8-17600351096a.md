The Pop Manifesto's visual language is a bold, high-contrast digital zine. It features stark black typography against vibrant, saturated backgrounds, often utilizing a single dominant color per section. The typography leans into a strong, editorial aesthetic with precise tracking and a clear hierarchy. Components are minimal, relying on color blocking and crisp text to define interactions rather than subtle shadows or rounded forms.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Midnight Ink (#000000) for all text and interactive borders to ensure maximum contrast.
- Implement Roobert 400 as the sole typeface, varying size and line height for hierarchy.
- Employ highly saturated, single-color backgrounds like Neon Pink (#ff29f1) or Electric Blue (#287aea) for distinct content blocks, ensuring visual separation.
- Maintain hard, 0px border-radius for all elements, including images and interactive areas.
- Utilize 291px for vertical section gaps to create generous negative space and a spacious feel.
- Apply 20px as the standard horizontal and vertical gap between related elements.
- Assume all interactivity is communicated through text link styles or color block background changes, not subtle hover states or shadows.

### Don't
- Do not use subtle background gradients or textures; stick to flat, vibrant color blocks.
- Avoid softer, desaturated or pastel colors, which would dilute the high-contrast aesthetic.
- Do not introduce rounded corners; all shapes should be sharp 0px radius to preserve the crisp, editorial look.
- Refrain from using drop shadows or complex elevation schemes; rely on color blocking for visual hierarchy.
- Do not use varied typography weights; Roobert 400 is the only weight. Change text size and line height for hierarchy.
- Do not use excessive white space within content blocks; reserve large spacing values for section separation only.
- Do not introduce decorative icons unless they are bold, single-color, and contribute explicitly to the high-contrast identity.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Electric Blue Canvas | `#287aea` | Base page background or primary content block background. |
| 1 | Neon Pink Surface | `#ff29f1` | Elevated content block background, providing strong visual distinction from the canvas. |

## Imagery
This site features a mix of photography styles: studio portraits with bold, single-color backdrops (like electric blue), candid lifestyle shots, and black-and-white portraits. Images are mostly contained within rectangular frames, with sharp edges, functioning as content rather than decorative backgrounds. They are high-density, taking up significant visual space to act as focal points.

## Layout
The page uses a full-bleed layout, where content sections stretch the full viewport width. The hero section features a prominent, centered headline over a vibrant background. Content frequently uses a multi-column grid, prominently a 3-column layout for images and associated text. Sections are separated by large vertical gaps (291px) and distinct, solid color changes, creating a strong, block-like rhythm. Navigation is minimal, likely a fixed top bar or simple links within the header and footer.
