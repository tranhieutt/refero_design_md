This design system evokes a sense of quiet authority and refined minimalism, akin to an exclusive gallery brochure. The predominant use of an off-white background with stark, near-black typography creates a high-contrast, yet soft, visual experience. Subtle variations in text sizes and minimal interactive elements guide the eye without visual clutter, emphasizing content discernment over flashy engagements. The aesthetic is built on precision, restraint, and an almost tactile purity, making every element feel deliberately placed.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Greige Canvas (#f9f7f4) as the default background for all pages and primary content sections.
- Apply Charcoal Text (#0c0c0c) for all primary text content at PP Neue Montreal weight 400, ensuring high contrast and clarity.
- Maintain a letter-spacing of -0.01em for all PP Neue Montreal typography to retain a tight, precise aesthetic.
- Implement 0px radius across all elements, including buttons and interactive components, for a sharp, angular visual.
- Use Pale Stone Divider (#e3e1dd) for subtle horizontal separators or faint borders where visual distinction is needed without strong emphasis.
- Structure layout with generous vertical spacing, using 50px as a common section separator for comfortable content segmentation.
- Prioritize scale and singular weight (400) of PP Neue Montreal to establish visual hierarchy, rather than multiple weights or colors.

### Don't
- Do not introduce additional font families; PP Neue Montreal is the only allowed typeface.
- Avoid using box-shadows or gradients; the design relies on flat planes and stark contrast for depth.
- Do not apply rounded corners to any component; maintain the consistent 0px radius for all elements.
- Refrain from using overly saturated or chromatic colors; the palette is strictly neutral with very subtle warm undertones.
- Do not add unnecessary padding or borders to interactive elements like navigation links; keep them minimal and text-based.
- Avoid decorative elements or iconography that deviates from the monochromatic and precise aesthetic.
- Do not vary font weights; all text, including headings, should be PP Neue Montreal 400.

## Imagery
The site's visual language is characterized by product photography that is meticulously staged and often features high-key lighting. Products are typically presented in clean, isolated contexts, showcasing material and form without lifestyle clutter. Photography serves an explanatory and showcase role, where the object itself is the focus, often with a subtle, brand-aligned color background or a pure white backdrop. There are no illustrations or abstract graphics; all visuals are rooted in tangible product representation. Images are generally contained within defined areas, not full-bleed, and maintain the sharp, unrounded edge aesthetic of the overall design. Density is moderate, with images acting as visual punctuation to text blocks.

## Layout
The site employs a contained layout model, centered, with a flexible maximum width that maintains generous side margins. The hero section features a large, left-aligned headline centered vertically, commanding immediate attention. The overall section rhythm is relatively flat, using consistent vertical spacing (around 50px) to separate content blocks, without alternating background patterns or strong visual dividers. Content arrangement primarily involves vertical stacking, with notable client lists appearing as aligned columns of text. There is no evident grid for cards, but image and text blocks are positioned for visual balance. The density is spacious, leaving ample 'white space' around elements. Navigation is a minimal top bar with left-aligned brand name and right-aligned 'Studio' link, adhering to the stark, minimalist aesthetic.
