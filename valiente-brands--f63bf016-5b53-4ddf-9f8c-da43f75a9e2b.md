This design system presents as a raw, almost brutalist exhibition of brand identity. A primary, vivid red against a near-white background commands attention, creating an aggressive, high-energy aesthetic. Typography is dense and tightly kerned, often acting as a visual element itself, reinforcing a sense of purposeful, impactful communication. The design feels like a bold statement rather than a polished interface, prioritizing directness and brand impact.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Pale Rose | `#e7a196` | `--color-pale-rose` | Rare background element, likely an unintentional browser artifact or a very subtle, almost unnoticeable background tint. |

Styled with GT Pressura, weight 400, size 16px, line-height 1.2. Default text color is Charcoal Black (#0a0a0a), with Valiente Crimson (#ff1a00) for active or hover states. No padding or borders, relying on color change for interaction feedback.

### Feature Card (Text-only)
**Role:** Displays specific features or project details.
These cards have no background color, border radius, box shadow, or padding (all 0px). They are essentially text blocks, allowing the content itself to be the primary focus over structural design. Text uses GT Pressura with varying sizes depending on hierarchy.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize Valiente Crimson (#ff1a00) for all interactive states and primary branding elements.
- Maintain tight letter-spacing for all text elements, particularly at larger sizes (e.g., -1.44px for 48px text, -12.25px for 245px text), using GT Pressura predominantly.
- Use a pure, flat background of Concrete White (#f5f5f5) for the majority of page sections.
- Ensure headings and key textual statements are rendered in Valiente Crimson (#ff1a00) to maximize brand presence and impact.
- Maintain strict 0px border-radius and box-shadow on all card-like elements, keeping the UI sharp and unadorned.
- Employ Charcoal Black (#0a0a0a) for most body copy to establish clear contrast against the light background.

### Don't
- Avoid using soft shadows or complex gradients; the aesthetic is flat and direct.
- Do not introduce curved corners or significant border-radii; all elements should maintain sharp 0px corners.
- Refrain from using varied weights or italic styles for GT Pressura; stick to weight 400 for consistency.
- Do not introduce any additional chromatic colors; limit the palette strictly to Valiente Crimson and the neutral shades.
- Avoid excessive whitespace around content blocks; the design prefers compactness and density, especially in text arrangement.
- Do not deviate from the established negative letter-spacing for text, as it is a core characteristic of the brand's typographic identity.

## Imagery
The site uses a mix of candid, dark-toned photography and abstract typography as visual elements. Photography, when present (like the boxing scene), appears full-bleed or large-scale, often with a moody, desaturated filter that contrasts strongly with the bright, text-centric UI. Imagery is used decoratively to evoke atmosphere rather than to explicitly explain content, relying on its emotional impact. There are also product/people shots with neutral or studio-like backgrounds, often focused on individuals, maintaining a raw, authentic feel without overt styling. Icons are minimal, resembling simple outlined shapes with sharp edges, consistently in Valiente Crimson, providing functional navigation cues while adhering to the bold aesthetic.

## Layout
The page primarily uses a max-width contained layout, likely around 1200-1440px, though a full-bleed video section interrupts this pattern for dramatic effect. The hero section is characterized by a unique staggered typography layout, creating a visual grid rather than a traditional centered headline. Sections are defined by consistent vertical spacing, creating an airy, uncluttered feel despite the dense typography. Content often appears in stacked blocks or implied two-column arrangements (e.g., text block left, implicit visual right), with a strong left alignment. Navigation is a minimalist top-right 'Get in Touch' button and a left-aligned, stacked text menu, both fixed or sticky. The overall rhythm is open and free-flowing, punctuated by bold text blocks.

Headline type 'â IMPACT-LED BRAND CONSULTANCY' in Valiente Crimson (#ff1a00), GT Pressura, weight 400, size 48px, line-height 1, letter-spacing -1.44px. Include a subtitle 'BRAVERY IN PRACTICE' below, in Valiente Crimson (#ff1a00), GT Pressura, weight 400, size 16px, line-height 1.2, letter-spacing -0.64px. Both text elements left-aligned within a max-width container, with elementGap 20px between them.
2.  **Generate a navigation link:** Text 'Services' in Charcoal Black (#0a0a0a), GT Pressura, weight 400, size 16px, line-height 1.2, letter-spacing -0.64px. On hover, change text color to Valiente Crimson (#ff1a00). No padding, borders, or background.

Followed by body text 'DJCTUVOCITEGUSCB KPYOHBRHIRGIFMNZACXRCYXCTR BXAMHNCS' in Charcoal Black (#0a0a0a), GT Pressura, weight 400, size 16px, line-height 1.2, letter-spacing -0.64px. Both elements left-aligned, with 20px vertical gap between them, on a Concrete White (#f5f5f5) background. The combined block should have 0px padding and 0px borderRadius.
