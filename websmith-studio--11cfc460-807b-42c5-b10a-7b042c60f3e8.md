## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize the Canvas (#f8f8f2) for page backgrounds, reserving Fog (#ffffff) for contained UI surfaces like cards.
- Use Ink (#1a1a1a) for all primary text, headlines, and interactive elements to maintain high contrast and legibility.
- Apply a consistent 12px border-radius to all image containers, content cards, and major UI blocks for a unified soft aesthetic.
- Maintain ample negative space using elementGap up to 16px and sectionGap up to 96px, allowing content to breathe.
- Use the system font `-apple-system` with `letter-spacing: -0.025em` for headlines 48px and larger, to achieve a tight, modern typographic feel.
- Introduce subtle accent colors (Mint, Sky Tint, Blush) primarily as card backgrounds for visual differentiation, avoiding their use as primary text or action colors.
- Keep elevation minimal or absent; when used, rely on subtle borders rather than heavy shadows to define elements.

### Don't
- Never use vibrant saturated colors for large UI areas; they are reserved for small, functional accent points like the Online Green status dot.
- Avoid decorative gradients; the design relies on flat colors and subtle textural differences between surfaces.
- Do not introduce strong drop shadows; the system prefers a flat, clean aesthetic with elevation defined by background color shifts or hairline borders.
- Refrain from using thin, light fonts for body copy; ensure sufficient contrast and readability with Ink (#1a1a1a) and appropriate weights.
- Do not deviate from the established 8px and 12px radii for buttons and cards; these values define the component softness.
- Avoid overly dense layouts or packing too much information into one section; maintain the spacious rhythm with generous padding and section gaps.
- Do not use browser default link colors; all links should be styled with Ink (#1a1a1a) and rely on subtle hover effects for interaction.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Canvas | `#f8f8f2` | Primary page background, setting a warm, desaturated base. |
| 1 | Fog | `#ffffff` | Elevated card backgrounds, providing a crisper surface for contained content. |

## Imagery
The site predominantly uses contained product screenshots, often depicting devices (phones, tablets, laptops) displaying digital user interfaces. These images are typically full-color, sharp, and placed within cards with 12px rounded corners. Photography is minimal, appearing in black and white for testimonials, treated with a softer, slightly desaturated feel. Icons are monochrome, simple, and outlined, serving as functional or decorative visual cues within content blocks.

## Layout
The page maintains a max-width contained layout of 1340px, centered on the Canvas background. The hero section features a prominent, centered headline and subtext. Content follows a rhythm of alternating section types: large text blocks, 2-column card grids for collaborations and features, and a testimonial block with an image alongside text. Vertical section gaps are generous (64-96px), creating breathing room. Navigation is a sticky top bar with logo left and textual links right. There are distinct section headers aligned left, followed by the respective content blocks.
