Yinka Ilori Studio operates with a vibrant, playful maximalism, driven by bold color contrasts and an expressive, geometric typeface for headlines. The core palette is built around high-saturation pinks, oranges, and greens, creating an energetic and optimistic atmosphere. Typography balances a striking display sans-serif with a more conventional, readable sans for body text. Layouts embrace large, often abstract, graphic elements as backgrounds, with UI elements remaining minimal and functional against the lively backdrops.

Text link in Ink (#000000), Haas Grotesk Display R Web, weight 400 at 20px, with normal line height. Bordered in Ink (#000000) at 3px on hover/active states for a subtle yet distinct interaction cue. Right margin of 30px.

### Hero Headline
**Role:** Large central title
Yinka Sans Ultra, weight 400, 120px size, line height 1.1, letter spacing 4px. Color is Ink (#000000) or Canvas Blush (#f5e5e5) depending on background contrast. Appears centered and prominent.

### Text Section Divider
**Role:** Visual separator for content sections
A 3px solid border in Ink (#000000) used as a horizontal rule (HR element) to visually break up content blocks.

### Animated Background Pattern
**Role:** Dynamic visual element
Large-scale, repeating organic shapes composed of Passion Pink (#d9698c), Zesty Orange (#ee6d22), and Lush Green (#1f8029) circles. These patterns fill entire sections, serving as the expressive backdrop for minimal UI. Features smooth transform and filter animations over 0.35s with an ease timing function. Radius is 9999px for the circular shapes.

### Sectional Background
**Role:** Alternating background fills for distinct content blocks
Typically Canvas Blush (#f5e5e5) for most content sections, with occasional sections using Passion Pink (#d9698c) as a solid background.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Prioritize high visual contrast between text and background, typically using Ink (#000000) on Canvas Blush (#f5e5e5) or on vibrant accent colors.
- Use Yinka Sans Ultra exclusively for large, primary headlines to maintain the brand's distinct typographic identity and visual impact.
- Employ Haas Grotesk Display R Web for all body text, navigation elements, and secondary headings, ensuring readability.
- Utilize Passion Pink (#d9698c), Zesty Orange (#ee6d22), and Lush Green (#1f8029) as primary colors for large, abstract, and often animated graphic backgrounds.
- Maintain minimal UI elementsânavigation, text, and iconsâto allow the vibrant background graphics to dominate the visual field.
- Apply a 3px solid border in Ink (#000000) for subtle emphasis on interactive elements or as content section dividers.
- Use 15px for small element spacing, 30px for padding and column gaps in denser layouts, and 175px for vertical section separation.

### Don't
- Do not introduce new color hues beyond the established palette of Ink, Canvas Blush, Passion Pink, Zesty Orange, and Lush Green.
- Avoid using Yinka Sans Ultra for body text or small elements, as its design is optimized for large scale and impact, not extended readability.
- Do not use thin or low-contrast borders; all borders should be a distinct 3px Ink (#000000) for clarity.
- Resist adding unnecessary decorative shadows or complex gradients to UI elements, as the visual dynamism comes from colors and graphic patterns.
- Do not deviate from the established spacing system; consistent use of 15px, 30px, and 175px values will maintain the comfortable density.
- Avoid using imagery with realistic or photographic styles; the visual language relies on abstract, graphic, and highly stylized forms.
- Do not use subtle motion or slow transitions; elements that move should do so with an expressive, often energetic, ease timing function over 0.35s.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Canvas Blush | `#f5e5e5` | Base page background and default surface for content blocks |
| 1 | Passion Pink | `#d9698c` | Background for bold, immersive content sections, providing a strong visual shift |

## Imagery
The site uses a strong, abstract graphic language instead of traditional imagery. Visuals consist of large-scale, repeating organic shapes (waves, circles) rendered in the brand's vibrant color palette (Passion Pink, Zesty Orange, Lush Green). These act as dynamic, full-bleed backgrounds often with fluid animation, creating an immersive, playful atmosphere. There are no photographs or product shots in the conventional sense; the focus is on graphic composition and color interaction. Icons are minimal, filled geometric shapes, primarily in Ink (#000000), acting as functional UI elements rather than detailed illustrations.

## Layout
The page adheres to a mostly full-bleed model, especially for hero sections and abstract graphic backgrounds, with content generally centered or spanning the full width. The hero section often features a large, dynamic graphic background with a centrally placed, impactful headline. Sections flow vertically with comfortable spacing (175px), occasionally alternating background colors between Canvas Blush and Passion Pink. Within content blocks, text and minimal UI elements are stacked centrally or arranged in simple column configurations. Navigation is a split header with 'Work' and 'About' on the left, and 'Journal', 'Contact', 'Store', 'Foundation' on the right, all in Ink (#000000).
